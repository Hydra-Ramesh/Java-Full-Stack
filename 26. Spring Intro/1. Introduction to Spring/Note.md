## ðŸŒ± **Introduction to Spring Framework**

### 1. **What is Spring Framework?**
- Spring is a **comprehensive Java framework** designed for building robust, enterprise-grade applications.
- It simplifies Java development by providing tools for:
  - **Dependency Management**
  - **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**
  - **Web Development**
  - **Database Access**
  - **Security and Transaction Management**

---

### 2. **Why Spring?**
- Traditional frameworks like:
  - **Struts** (Web)
  - **Hibernate** (ORM)
  - â€¦are limited to specific concerns.
- **Spring** offers a **complete solution** covering:
  - Web
  - Database
  - Security
  - Transactions
- Makes development easier by reducing boilerplate code and managing complexity.

---

### 3. **Core Features of Spring**
âœ… **POJO-Based Development**  
- Build applications using **Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs)** without tight framework coupling.

âœ… **Dependency Injection (DI)**  
- Manages object creation and dependencies, promoting **loose coupling**.

âœ… **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**  
- Cleanly separates **cross-cutting concerns** like logging, security, and transactions from business logic.

### 4. **Main Spring Modules**
| Module        | Description |
|-------------- |------------|
| **Spring Core** | Fundamental features like **DI**, **BeanFactory** |
| **Spring AOP** | Handles modularized cross-cutting concerns |
| **Spring ORM** | Integrates with **Hibernate**, **JPA**, and other ORM tools |
| **Spring MVC** | Simplifies **web application development** using the **MVC design pattern** |
| **Spring Boot** | Rapid application development with **embedded servers** like Tomcat or Jetty |

### 5. **Why Choose Spring?**
- âœ… **Lightweight and Modular**
- âœ… **Clean and Maintainable Code**
- âœ… **Supports diverse technologies:** Web, ORM, Security, etc.
- âœ… **Highly flexible** and easily integrates with other frameworks and libraries
