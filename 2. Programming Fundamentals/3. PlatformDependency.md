# **Platform and Platform Dependency**  

Java is widely recognized for its **platform independence**, a feature often described using the term **WORA (Write Once, Run Anywhere)**. Besides this, Java supports **object-oriented programming**, is **architecturally neutral**, **portable**, and **robust**, among other advantages.  

Before exploring these features, it is essential to understand **what a platform is** and **what platform dependency means**. Once we grasp these concepts, we can better appreciate how Java achieves **platform independence**.

## **1. What is a Platform?**  

A **platform** is the combination of **hardware** and **software** that provides an environment for applications to run.  

### **Two Main Components of a Platform:**  
‚úî **Software (Operating System - OS)**  
   - Examples: **Windows, Linux, macOS**  
‚úî **Hardware (Processor Architecture)**  
   - Examples: **Intel, AMD Ryzen, Apple Silicon (ARM-based processors)**  

As developers, we primarily focus on the **software aspect** of platforms.

## **2. What is Platform Dependency?**  

### **Understanding Platform Dependency with an Example**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ Suppose we build an application in **C language** on a system running **Windows OS**.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ The **C compiler** converts the program (written in HLL - High-Level Language) into **MLL (Machine-Level Language)**.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ The output of this process is an **executable file** with a `.exe` extension.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ If we try to run this `.exe` file on **Linux** or **macOS**, it **won‚Äôt work** because it was compiled specifically for **Windows OS**.  

### **Why?**  
- The machine-level code generated by the C compiler is **platform-specific**.  
- Each OS has a different system architecture, so a program compiled for one OS cannot run on another.  

üî¥ **This is called Platform Dependency.**

## **3. How Java Achieves Platform Independence**  

Unlike C, Java is **platform-independent**. But how does Java overcome platform dependency?  

‚úî Both **Java and C use HLL** for programming.  
‚úî However, the **converted MLL (Machine-Level Language) is usually platform-dependent**.  
‚úî Java **solves this issue with a unique approach**.  

In the next chapter, we will explore the **internal architecture of Java** and how it enables platform independence.

## **Conclusion**  

üîπ **Platform dependency** means that an application compiled on one OS cannot run on another.  
üîπ **Languages like C are platform-dependent**, while **Java overcomes this limitation**.  
üîπ **In the next chapter**, we will uncover the **Java architecture** that makes "Write Once, Run Anywhere" possible!
