## âœ… **Module 1: Solution with Virtualization (VMs)**

### ðŸ”Ž **Problem**:
You need to run multiple applications requiring different software environments and dependencies on a single physical machine. Without isolation, they conflict and cause version mismatches.

### ðŸ’» **Solution Using Virtualization**:
- Install a **hypervisor** (like VMware, VirtualBox, or Hyper-V) on the physical server.
- Create **Virtual Machines (VMs)** for each application:
  - Each VM runs its own **Operating System** (Windows, Linux, etc.).
  - Each VM contains **application code, runtime, and dependencies**.
- Run different apps in separate VMs without conflicts.

### âœ… **Advantages**:
- Strong **isolation** (faults in one VM donâ€™t affect others).
- Supports **different operating systems** simultaneously.
- Secure and well-understood for legacy apps.

### âš  **Limitations**:
| Problem                    | Explanation |
|---------------------------|------------|
| High Resource Usage       | Each VM runs a full OS, consuming a lot of CPU, memory, and storage. |
| Slow Boot & Performance   | VM startup takes **minutes**, resource-heavy. |
| Complex Maintenance       | Each VM needs individual OS updates and patching. |
| Difficult Scaling          | Scaling means creating new full VMs, increasing resource usage. |
