### **Abstract Data Type (ADT)**  

#### **1. What is an Abstract Data Type (ADT)?**  
An **Abstract Data Type (ADT)** is a **mathematical model** for a data structure that defines its **behavior** (operations) without specifying its **implementation**.  

ðŸ”¹ **Key Idea:**  
- Focuses on **what** operations are performed rather than **how** they are implemented.  
- Provides a **logical description** without exposing the internal working.  

#### **2. Real-World Example of ADT**  
Consider a **bank account**:  
- You can **deposit**, **withdraw**, and **check balance**.  
- You **donâ€™t need to know** how the bankâ€™s system processes your money.  
- The internal implementation is hidden from the user.

### **Common Abstract Data Types & Their Operations**  

| **ADT** | **Description** | **Common Operations** | **Real-World Example** |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **List** | Ordered collection of elements. | Insert, Delete, Access | **To-do list** (Tasks are arranged in order). |
| **Stack** (LIFO) | Last In, First Out structure. | Push, Pop, Peek | **Stack of plates** (Last plate added is removed first). |
| **Queue** (FIFO) | First In, First Out structure. | Enqueue, Dequeue, Front | **Queue at a ticket counter** (First person in line is served first). |
| **Deque (Double-Ended Queue)** | Elements can be added or removed from both ends. | Insert Front/Back, Remove Front/Back | **Train compartments** (Can be added/removed from both ends). |
| **Priority Queue** | Queue where elements have priority. | Enqueue with priority, Dequeue | **Emergency Room** (Critical patients get treated first). |
| **Map (Dictionary)** | Stores key-value pairs. | Insert, Delete, Search | **Phonebook** (Contacts stored with names as keys). |
| **Set** | Collection of unique elements. | Insert, Remove, Check if Exists | **Student roll numbers** (No duplicates allowed). |

### **3. Why Use ADTs?**  
âœ… **Encapsulation** â€“ Hides implementation details.  
âœ… **Reusability** â€“ Can be implemented using different data structures.  
âœ… **Modularity** â€“ Makes code easier to manage and maintain.

### **4. How is ADT Implemented?**  
- ADTs are implemented using **concrete data structures** like **arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.**  
- Example: A **Stack ADT** can be implemented using either an **array** or a **linked list**.
